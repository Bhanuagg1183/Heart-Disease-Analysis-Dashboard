# Heart-Disease-Dataset-Analysis

Here are the quick insights about your heart disease dataset:



## **Dataset Overview:**


Size: 1,025 patient records with 12 features

Target: Binary classification (heart disease presence/absence)



## **Key Demographics:**


Age Range: 20-77 years (average ~54 years)

Gender Split: ~68% male, ~32% female

Heart Disease Rate: ~54% of patients have heart disease



## **Important Features:**


Age: Continuous variable, most patients in 50-60 range

Sex: 1=male, 0=female

Chest Pain Type: 4 types (1-4)

Resting BP: Blood pressure values

Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol levels (some zero values indicate missing data)

Max Heart Rate: Exercise-induced maximum heart rate

Exercise Angina: Exercise-induced chest pain

ST Slope: Slope of peak exercise ST segment



## **Data Quality Notes:**


Some cholesterol values are 0 (likely missing data)

Generally clean dataset suitable for machine learning

Good balance between positive and negative cases



## **Potential Use Cases:**


Binary classification for heart disease prediction

Feature importance analysis for cardiac risk factors

Medical research and clinical decision support


The dataset appears well-suited for developing predictive models for heart disease diagnosis based on clinical parameters.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
